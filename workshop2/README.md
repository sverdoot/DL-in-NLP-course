In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training
Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
- understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered
  architectures
- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**
- implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks
- implement **Dropout** to regularize networks
- implement **Batch Normalization** and **Layer Normalization** for training deep networks
- understand and implement both Vanilla RNNs and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks


### Task 1: Softmax
The IPython Notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing linear classifier.

### Task 2: Two-Layer Neural Network
The IPython Notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier

### Task 3: Fully-connected Neural Network
The IPython notebook `task3_FullyConnectedNets.ipynb` will introduce you to our
modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected
networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several
popular update rules.

### Task 4: Dropout
The IPython notebook `task4_Dropout.ipynb` will help you implement Dropout and explore
its effects on model generalization.

### Task 5: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs
The Jupyter notebook `task5_RNN_Captioning.ipynb` will walk you through the implementation of
an image captioning system on MS-COCO using vanilla recurrent networks.

### Task 6: Image Captioning with LSTMs
The Jupyter notebook LSTM_Captioning.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs, and apply them to image captioning on MS-COCO.

### Task 7: Layer Normalization
This task is fully optional and has no deadline.

In the IPython notebook `task7_LayerNormalization.ipynb` you will implement batch
normalization and layer normalization, and use them to train deep fully-connected networks.
